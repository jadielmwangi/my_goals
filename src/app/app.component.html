<!-- add navbar selector to our root template file. -->

<app-navbar></app-navbar>


<!-- <app-goal></app-goal> -->
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
<!-- We have replaced the <app-goal> selector with the <router-outlet> selector because the router will be responsible for views from now on. If we keep the <app-goal> selector, our app will display the goal component and its child components only, which beats our purpose for creating routes.  -->
